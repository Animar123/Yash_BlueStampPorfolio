# Final Milestone
For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

# Second Milestone
For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

# First Milestone
My project, Raspberry Pi Object Dection, utilizes a tensorflow and the YOLOv5 API in order to reconize objects. My first milestone was installing OpenCV, TensorFlow, and other nessesary libraries onto the raspberry PI. To access the camera, I use openCV in order to take pictures/videos and store them on the raspberry Pi. I then utilize tensorflow and the YOLOv5 model in order to recognize objects. I then wrote my own code in the detect.py program order for the raspberry PI to take a picture and then automatically analize it utilizing the model and display the result.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Starter Project
![Headstone Image](starter.png)
This basic project allows for anyone to turn off any TV by simply turning the device on and pointing it at the TV. It then emmits a IR light that will turn of any TV. The project was great for learning how to solder and understanding basic electronics
